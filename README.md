# Mechatronics-workshop
ðŸ”§ Mechatronics Workshop Projects 

Mechatronics Workshop focused on the integration of mechanical, electrical, and programming principles. The workshop provided practical experience in designing and implementing systems involving Arduino-based automation, data acquisition, and control simulations.

ðŸš€ Key Projects:
Line Follower Robot
Designed and programmed an autonomous robot to follow a line using IR and line sensors. Covered hardware integration (Arduino Uno, L298N motor driver), sensor calibration, and real-time control coding.

Data Acquisition System (DAQ)
Built a light intensity measurement system using LDRs. Focused on analog signal acquisition, sensor calibration, and real-time data display on an LCD.

Control System Simulation (Scilab)
Simulated dynamic responses of Single Degree of Freedom (SDOF) systems. Explored the effects of system parameters (stiffness, damping) using unit step response analysis.

Bluetooth-Enabled Robot
Developed a dual-mode robot (autonomous/manual) using Bluetooth modules (e.g., HC-05). Enabled mobile app control and explored wireless communication protocols.

ðŸ’¡ Skills & Tools:
Arduino IDE programming, sensor interfacing, analog signal processing

Hardware assembly, soldering, and troubleshooting

Scilab for control system modeling and simulation

Teamwork, debugging, and iterative problem-solving
